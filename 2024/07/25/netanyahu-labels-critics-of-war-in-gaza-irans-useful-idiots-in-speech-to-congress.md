Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out against protests of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, broadly disparaging anti-Israel protesters as “Iran’s useful idiots” in an address to Congress on Wednesday.

Netanyahu’s address to Congress comes at a crucial crossroads for the war. US officials have voiced optimism about the prospects of a deal that could free Hamas-held hostages and bring the conflict to an end. It also comes as many on the left have become increasingly dissatisfied with the way Netanyahu has waged the war, which has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and left Gaza in the grips of a humanitarian catastrophe.

The Israeli prime minister’s nearly hour-long address to Congress struck a bellicose tone as he vowed to “fight until we achieve victory.” Netanyahu falsely downplayed and deflected on the role of Israel in causing the ongoing civilian strife in Gaza. Although he made some reference to efforts to bring the hostages home, significantly more of the speech focused on the ongoing war and took aim at his foes – Iran, the International Criminal Court and protesters.

The US has seen protests across the country on college campuses and elsewhere in opposition to the war against Hamas. On the day of Netanyahu’s speech, there were protests both outside and inside the US Capitol complex. Additionally, the Secret Service is investigating reports that protesters gained access to the hotel building where Netanyahu is staying in Washington, DC, releasing bugs in the hotel and pulling fire alarms, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Netanyahu painted protesters with a broad brush, claiming that “many choose to stand with evil” and that “they stand with Hamas” and “rapists and murderers.”

While Netanyahu heavily criticized protests against the war, both President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have affirmed the right to protest and indicated they believe pro-Palestinian protesters have legitimate grievances – while still criticizing rhetoric that has devolved into antisemitism.

Speaking at a news conference in April, Blinken said he understands the “strong, passionate feelings” people have about the bloodshed in Gaza.

“It’s a hallmark of our democracy that our citizens make known their views, their concerns, their anger at any given time. And I think that reflects the strength of the country, the strength of democracy,” he said about pro-Palestinian protests.

Biden, who has repeatedly faced pro-Palestinian protests at his public events this year, often appears conciliatory toward those interrupting him.

“I understand the passion,” he said after he was repeatedly interrupted during a campaign event at a South Carolina church earlier this year.

In his address to Congress, Netanyahu referenced a recent statement from US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines that Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the US related to the conflict in Gaza.

In her statement, Haines said, however, that she wanted “to be clear that I know Americans who participate in protests are, in good faith, expressing their views on the conflict in Gaza,” adding that “this intelligence does not indicate otherwise.”

“I have a message for these protesters: When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran’s useful idiots,” Netanyahu said.

Some members of Congress, mostly Democrats, did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, either as a protest of the war or due to previously scheduled events. The Israel-Hamas war has increasingly become a dividing line among Democrats, exposing rifts within the party.

At one point, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a sign during the speech that on one side said: “war criminal,” and the other side said: “guilty of genocide.”

Netanyahu slammed those accusing Israel of genocide, suggesting that such accusations were antisemitic.

“The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize Israel, to demonize the Jewish state, and to demonize Jews everywhere,” he said.

Netanyahu specifically slammed the International Criminal Court’s allegations that Israel is starving Palestinians in Gaza, calling it “utter, complete nonsense” and “a complete fabrication.”

According to the UN, 96% of the population of Gaza currently faces “crisis or worse levels of food insecurity.” Humanitarian aid workers say the war and restrictions imposed by the Israeli government on aid access to Gaza have brought the strip to the brink.

### Netanyahu thanks Biden and emphasizes close US-Israel ties

Netanyahu thanked Biden during his speech for his support for Israel, even as Biden’s relationship with Netanyahu has grown steadily colder as the war in Gaza has lagged on and as the death toll in the beleaguered enclave continues to rise. Both leaders have known each other for decades, but have traded not-so-subtle barbs at each other as their disagreements with the war’s future have spilled into the public.

“I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on October 7,” he said, thanking Biden “for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.”

The speech to Congress comes as the bulk of the nation’s attention has been focused in recent weeks on discussions surrounding Biden’s age and mental fitness – which culminated in Biden announcing over the weekend that he would step down from the Democratic ticket – along with the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Convention.

“President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,” Netanyahu said.

During his speech to Congress, Netanyahu emphasized the importance of close ties between the US and Israel.

“For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,” Netanyahu said to loud cheers from lawmakers in attendance. “Because when we stand together, something very simple happens: We win, they lose.”

There were moments of bipartisanship during the speech. Twice when Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden, both sides gave him a standing ovation. When Netanyahu condemned political violence, that prompted another standing ovation from both sides.

Biden is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.

Biden has said that Israel has reached its stated goal, described the country’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” and plainly stated his desire for the war to end. The president has said it is “uncertain” whether Israel had committed war crimes. He has also hinted that he believes Netanyahu is dragging out the war only for the sake of his own political survival.

Netanyahu, meanwhile, has accused the United States of “withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,” claims that American officials flatly rejected.

Netanyahu forcefully defended Israel’s right to self-defense in his remarks, saying, “the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled. Israel will always defend itself.”

“As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.

After arriving in Washington earlier this week, Netanyahu met with some American relatives of hostages held by Hamas. Not all participants were pleased with how that meeting ended.

Trump and Netanyahu will also meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.

### Some Democrats skip speech

A number of Democratic lawmakers did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, with some declining to attend in protest over the war or because of previously scheduled events.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, did not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu’s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, but she is planning to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official told CNN. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would skip the address in protest of the “total war” Netanyahu’s government has waged in Gaza.

“No. Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress,” Sanders said in a statement. “On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned.”
