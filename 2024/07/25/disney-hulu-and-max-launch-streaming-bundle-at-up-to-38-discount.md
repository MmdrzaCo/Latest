Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney launched a cross-studio bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and Max on Thursday in the US as the entertainment giants look to scale their streaming businesses.

The companies said the bundle of the three services, which was first announced in May, is available to new and returning subscribers for $16.99 a month with ads, or $29.99 a month without ads — an up to 38% savings over the standalone pricing of each platform.

The new bundle offers subscribers access to a wider array of programming, including the premium service HBO, and content from ABC, CNN, Discovery, the Food Network, FX, HGTV, Hulu, Pixar, and the Star Wars franchise. The collaborative effort also brings together two major comic-book rivals, Warner Bros. DC and Disney’s Marvel, in a single cooperative venture.

The launch of the bundle comes as WBD, the parent company of CNN, and Disney, which owns both Disney+ and Hulu, look to woo and retain subscribers as in a battle against larger rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.

Smaller streaming platforms have struggled in recent years to retain subscribers in an increasingly crowded sector that also includes NBC’s Peacock, Paramount+, and Apple TV+. Making matters more complicated, Hallmark announced earlier this month that it, too, will join the fray, launching its own standalone streaming platform, Hallmark+, ahead of the holiday season.

The emergence of the combined services resemble traditional cable television bundles. Disney already offers its own bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. In December, Verizon announced a new streaming subscription that paired Netflix and Max’s ad-supported tiers for $10 a month, a deal that, for an additional $10, includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN.
