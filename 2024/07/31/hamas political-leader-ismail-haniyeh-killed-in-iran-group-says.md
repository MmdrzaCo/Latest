Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh has been killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, Iranian state media Press TV reported Wednesday, citing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Hamas issued a statement shortly after the announcement saying Haniyeh was killed in a “Zionist raid” on his residence in Tehran after he participated in the inauguration of the new Iranian president.

CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on Hamas’ claim.

It is not clear when Haniyeh was killed. The new Iranian president was sworn in on Tuesday.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
