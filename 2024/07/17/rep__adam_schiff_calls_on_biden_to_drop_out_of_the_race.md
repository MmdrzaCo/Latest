Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the most prominent elected Democrat to publicly call on President Joe Biden to drop out the race.

“While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,” Schiff said in a statement.

The California Democrat, who is running for US Senate and served as an impeachment manager during one of Trump’s impeachments, has been one of the sharpest critics of the former president.

Schiff is the first Democrat to publicly call on Biden to leave the race since the failed assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend.
