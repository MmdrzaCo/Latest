North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has taken himself out of consideration to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ potential running mate, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.

Cooper, viewed as one of the top contenders for the role, is said to have expressed concern about going through the veepstakes process at age 67. There has also been concern among some Democrats about Mark Robinson, the state’s Republican lieutenant governor whom the state constitution says would perform the governor’s duties when the governor is absent from the state.

CNN has reached out to a representative for Cooper. The Harris campaign declined to comment.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
