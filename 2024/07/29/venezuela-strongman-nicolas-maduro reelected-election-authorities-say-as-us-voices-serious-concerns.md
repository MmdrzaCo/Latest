Nicolás Maduro, the authoritarian leader of Venezuela, has been reelected president, the election authority has announced, as the country’s opposition alleged voting irregularities and the United States voiced “serious concerns” about the results.

With 80% of votes counted, the longtime strongman won more than 51% of the vote, besting the Democratic Unitary Platform (PUD) candidate Edmundo González Urrutia, who gained more than 44%, according to a statement by the National Electoral Council (CNE).

Maduro will hold office for a third consecutive six-year term – representing the continuity of “Chavismo” in power, which started in 1999 at the hands of former president Hugo Chávez. Maduro has been in power since Chávez’s death in 2013.

The vote has come at a crucial moment for Venezuela, an oil-rich nation that experienced the worst economic crash of a peacetime country in recent history. Maduro has blamed foreign sanctions against his regime, saying Venezuela is victim of an “economic war.”

Meanwhile, the opposition — which has been galvanized this election cycle, posing the most significant threat to Maduro’s grip on power in years — had promised to restore Venezuela’s democracy and rebuild the economy if they won.

Throughout the election process, there have been mounting concerns that the opposition will not see a fair contest, as Maduro’s government controls all public institutions in Venezuela including the Supreme Court – which could be the final arbiter on any claim of electoral fraud. The government has also been accused of rigging votes in the past, which it denied.

### Tears and celebrations

Voters had turned out in droves, with many saying they would leave the country if Maduro won — pointing to violent repression and economic collapse under his rule.

The results were met with mixed emotions in the capital Caracas, with Maduro supporters cheering and celebrating outside the president’s official residence. Meanwhile, opposition supporters were seen crying and hugging on the streets.

Earlier Sunday evening, opposition leaders claimed there were election irregularities — including opposition witnesses being denied access to the CNE headquarters as the authority counted votes, and the CNE allegedly halting data being sent from local polling stations to their central location to prevent more votes from being processed.

The run up to the vote was also marred by allegations of foul play.

The election campaign saw at least 71 people arbitrarily detained – the majority of whom provided some sort of service to the opposition – and a dozen online media outlets were blocked within the country, according to human rights organization Laboratorio de Paz.

The government a﻿lso created significant impediments for Venezuelans abroad to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements.

CNN has reached out to the CNE, which has not responded to the opposition’s allegations.

After the CNE announced Maduro’s win, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed “serious concerns that the result announced does not reflect the will or the votes of the Venezuelan people.”

He added that it was “critical” for votes to be counted fairly and transparently, and called for the CNE to publish its vote tabulations.

The opposition’s accusations may cast doubt on Venezuela returning to the international stage after Maduro pledged last year to hold free and fair elections in US-brokered talks, in exchange for sanctions relief.
