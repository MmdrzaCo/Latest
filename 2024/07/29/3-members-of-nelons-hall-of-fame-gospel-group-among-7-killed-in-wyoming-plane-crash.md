Three members of the Nelons, a Georgia-based family gospel group, were among seven people killed in a plane crash in Wyoming on Friday, according to a statement from the family’s management company.

Kelly Nelon Clark, her husband, Jason Clark, and their daughter Amber Kistler died in the crash Friday afternoon, according to a statement by daughter Autumn Nelon Streetman, who was not on the plane, that was included with the Gaither Music Group announcement.

“Thank you for the prayers that have been extended already to me, my husband, Jamie, and our soon-to-be-born baby boy, as well as Jason’s parents, Dan and Linda Clark,” said Nelon Streetman, who had traveled to Seattle with her husband. “We appreciate your continued prayers, love and support as we navigate the coming days.”

Also killed in the crash were Kistler’s husband, Nathan Kistler, and their assistant, Melodi Hodges, along with the plane’s pilot, Larry Haynie, and his wife, Melissa.

There were no survivors, according to the statement.

Haynie, the chairman of the Georgia Board of Corrections, was remembered by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in a social media post Saturday.

“Through a career of valued service in public safety, Larry’s impact on our state will not be forgotten,” Kemp wrote. “Our entire family is asking everyone to join us in praying for those who have been lost, for their loved ones and communities, and for those throughout the gospel music community who have lost dear friends in this heartbreaking accident.”

Described by their management company as “one of the best loved Gospel music families,” the group was traveling to join the Gaither Homecoming Cruise to Alaska, according to the Gaither Music Group, which also sponsors the cruise featuring numerous gospel singers and groups. The ship was to leave Seattle on Saturday afternoon. The Gaither statement said Nelon Streetman and her husband were notified of the deaths in Seattle and were returning to their home.

The Nelons were inducted into the Gospel Music Association (GMA) Hall of Fame in 2016 and were winners of 10 Gospel Music Association’s Dove Awards, including multiple song of the year and album of the year awards, according to the group’s official website.

According to the Dove Awards Website, the group’s most recent win was in  2021 for country/bluegrass/roots recorded song of the year, “If God Pulled Back The Curtain.”

“The GMA and our entire music community is grieving over the tragic loss of Jason, Kelly and Amber as well as the others involved in the tragic plane crash,” GMA president Jackie Patillo said on the organization’s website. “Our deepest condolences and prayers are with Autumn and the rest of the Nelon family. They will be forever cherished and remembered in the GMA Hall of Fame.”

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the accident, which involved a single engine turboprop Pilatus PC-12/47E.

“The aircraft is in a remote location and once they gain access, they will begin documenting the scene, examining the aircraft,” NTSB spokesperson Keith Holloway said in a statement Saturday. “The aircraft will then be recovered and taken to a secure facility for further evaluation.”

A preliminary report is expected in about 30 days while a final report with the probable cause of the crash could take up to two years to complete, Holloway added.
