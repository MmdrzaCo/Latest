Yemen’s Houthi rebels have blamed Israel for a series of strikes on a western port city that came a day after the Houthis claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv.

The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported airstrikes in Hodeidah on Saturday targeting oil facilities, adding that there had been deaths and injuries.

CNN has approached Israel for comment, but CNN contributor Barak Ravid, citing US officials, said Israel was behind the attacks.

If confirmed it would be the first time Israel has struck Yemen.

The drone attack in Tel Aviv on Friday killed one man and injured at least 10 others.

The Iran-back Houthis said the attack was a response to Israel’s war in Gaza, with a  spokesperson saying operation was performed by a new drone capable of “bypassing the enemy’s interception systems.”

This is a developing story and will be updated.
