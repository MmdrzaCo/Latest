The FBI is seeking to interview former President Donald Trump in its investigation of the assassination attempt to obtain a victim statement — a standard part of the investigation because he is a crime victim, according to a US official.

The FBI also said in a statement Thursday that investigators continue to examine bullet fragments and other evidence in the attack on Trump at his Pennsylvania rally this month, but that the agency has always considered the shooting an attempted assassination of the former president.

The bureau issued the statement in response to questions about FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, in which he said there’s still “some question” about whether Trump was hit with a bullet or shrapnel.

Questions about Trump’s wound have stoked political backlash. Trump has said he “took a bullet for democracy,” and his campaign pushed back on any implication otherwise.

“Anyone who believes this conspiracy bullsh*t is either mentally deficient or willfully peddling falsehoods for political reasons,” Trump adviser Steven Cheung told CNN.
