Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, co-founder and alleged current leader of the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, is in US custody, according to a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the case.

Joaquin Guzman Lopez, son of cartel co-founder Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman and another alleged leader of the cartel, is also in federal custody, said Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Both men are facing several charges for leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including it’s “deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said.

The Sinaloa Cartel, named after the Mexican state where the gang was formed, is one of the most powerful drug-trafficking groups in the world, known for trafficking fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin into the United States.

The latest indictment against Zambada, one of the most notorious drug traffickers in Mexico’s history, was in February. It charged him with conspiring to manufacture and distribute a substance containing fentanyl, according to the US Justice Department.

From 1989 to 2024, Zambada imported and distributed “massive amounts of narcotics,” generating billions of dollars in profits, according to the February indictment.

Federal prosecutors said he employed people to obtain “transportation routes and warehouses” to import and store narcotics, along with hit men, or sicarios, to carry out kidnappings and murders in Mexico “to retaliate against rivals who threatened the cartel.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
