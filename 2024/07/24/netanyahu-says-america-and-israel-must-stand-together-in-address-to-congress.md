Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the importance of close ties between the US and Israel and warned against antisemitism in an address to Congress on Wednesday that sought to shore up American support for Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza.

“For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,” Netanyahu said to loud cheers from lawmakers in attendance. “Because when we stand together, something very simple happens: We win, they lose.”

Netanyahu’s address to Congress comes at a crucial crossroads for the war. US officials have voiced optimism about the prospects of a deal that could free Hamas-held hostages and bring the conflict to an end. It also comes as many on the left have become increasingly dissatisfied with the way Netanyahu has waged the war, which has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians and left Gaza in the grips of a humanitarian catastrophe.

Some members of Congress, mostly Democrats, did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, either as a protest of the war or due to previously scheduled events. The Israel-Hamas war has increasingly become a dividing line among Democrats, exposing rifts within the party.

At one point, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian-American congresswoman, held up a sign during the speech that on one side said: “war criminal” and the other side said: “guilty of genocide.”

Netanyahu warned against antisemitism in his remarks and broadly criticized protests against the war in Gaza and the Israeli government, arguing that they are misguided.

“Antisemitism is the world’s oldest hatred,” he said. “Just as malicious lies were leveled for centuries at the Jewish people, malicious lies are now being leveled at the Jewish state. The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize Israel, to demonize the Jewish state and to demonize Jews everywhere.”

Netanyahu forcefully defended Israel’s right to self-defense in his remarks, saying, “the hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled. Israel will always defend itself.”

“As we defend ourselves on all fronts, I know that America has our back and I thank you for it – all sides of the aisle,” Netanyahu said.

There were moments of bipartisanship during the speech. Twice when Netanyahu praised President Joe Biden, both sides gave him a standing ovation. When Netanyahu condemned political violence, that prompted another standing ovation from both sides.

### Netanyahu thanks Biden in speech

Netanyahu thanked Biden during his speech for his support for Israel, even as Biden’s relationship with Netanyahu has grown steadily colder as the war in Gaza has lagged on and as the death toll in the beleaguered enclave continues to rise. Both leaders have known each other for decades, but have traded not-so-subtle barbs at each other as their disagreements with the war’s future have spilled into the public.

“I thank President Biden for his heartfelt support for Israel after the savage attack on October 7,” he said and thanked Biden “for his tireless efforts on behalf of the hostages and for his efforts to the hostage families as well.”

The speech to Congress comes as the bulk of the nation’s attention has been focused in recent weeks on discussions surrounding Biden’s age and mental fitness – which culminated in Biden announcing over the weekend that he would step down from the Democratic ticket – along with the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and the Republican National Convention.

“President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years. I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,” Netanyahu said.

Biden is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.

Biden has said that Israel has reached its stated goal, described the country’s actions in Gaza as “over the top,” and plainly stated his desire for the war to end. The president has said it is “uncertain” whether Israel had committed war crimes. He has also hinted that he believes Netanyahu is dragging out the war only for the sake of his own political survival.

Netanyahu, meanwhile, has accused the United States of “withholding weapons and ammunitions to Israel,” claims that American officials flatly rejected.

After arriving in Washington earlier this week, Netanyahu met with some American relatives of hostages held by Hamas. Not all participants were pleased with how that meeting ended.

Trump and Netanyahu will also meet Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump announced Tuesday.

### Some Democrats skip speech

A number of Democratic lawmakers did not attend Netanyahu’s speech, with some declining to attend in protest over the war or because of previously scheduled events.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, did not preside in her constitutional role as president of the Senate during Netanyahu’s address; Harris will be in Indianapolis Wednesday, but is planning to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official told CNN. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside over the speech.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent of Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would skip the address in protest of the “total war” Netanyahu’s government has waged in Gaza.

“No. Netanyahu should not be welcomed into the United States Congress,” Sanders said in a statement. “On the contrary, his policies in Gaza and the West Bank and his refusal to support a two-state solution should be roundly condemned.”
