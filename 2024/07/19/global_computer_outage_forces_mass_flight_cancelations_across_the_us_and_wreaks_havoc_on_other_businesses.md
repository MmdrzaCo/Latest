All flights from several major US airlines were temporarily grounded Friday morning due to a communication issue – part of a technical disaster impacting businesses worldwide.

A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the ground stop impacted all flights from those airlines, regardless of their destination, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

As of mid-Friday morning, more than 1,000 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com.

“The FAA is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the FAA posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”

The CEO of CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, said the IT issue causing a global outage has been identified and a fix has been deployed.

“CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”

The technical crisis also affected international airlines as well as mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, Hong Kong Disneyland and the Israeli health service.

### What US airlines are saying

Microsoft said service went down for some customers in the central United States around 6 p.m. ET Thursday, “including failures with service management operations and connectivity or availability of services,” according to the Azure cloud software status report site.

The company said it determined the cause and is working to fix it. A company spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
