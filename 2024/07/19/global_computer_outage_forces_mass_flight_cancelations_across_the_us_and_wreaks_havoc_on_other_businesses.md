Hundreds of US flights were grounded Friday morning due to a technical disaster impacting businesses worldwide – leading to cancellations, delays and confusion at airports across the country.

A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the crisis has also affected international airlines as well as mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; some 911 operations in the United States; banking in Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong’s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service.

As of Friday morning, more than 1,200 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport told passengers to not even come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Travelers at the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to funerals or other momentous events.

Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses

“The FAA is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the Federal Aviation Administration posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”

CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”

Kurtz later told NBC, “We’re resolving and have resolved the issue.”

“As systems come back online, as they’re rebooted, they’re coming up and they’re working,” Kurtz said on the “Today” show Friday morning. However, Kurtz said, it could be “some time” for certain systems that won’t just automatically recover.
