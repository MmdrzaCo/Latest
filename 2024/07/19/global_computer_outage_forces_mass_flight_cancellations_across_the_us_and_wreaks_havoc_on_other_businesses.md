Hundreds of US flights were grounded Friday morning due to a technical disaster impacting businesses worldwide – leading to cancellations, delays and confusion at airports across the country.

A cybersecurity company said the debacle is “not a security incident or cyberattack.” But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, businesses and even emergency services around the world.

As of Friday morning, more than 1,400 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport told passengers to not even come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events.

“So tomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon. And then on Sunday, I have my sister’s 50th birthday party,” said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Friday. “It’s really chaotic. It’s frustrating. And I’ve never experienced anything like this before at this airport.”

Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses

“The FAA is closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,” the Federal Aviation Administration posted on social media. “Several airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.”

CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, “is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,” CEO George Kurtz posted on X. “This is not a security incident or cyberattack.”

Kurtz later told NBC, “We’re resolving and have resolved the issue.”

“As systems come back online, as they’re rebooted, they’re coming up and they’re working,” Kurtz said on the “Today” show Friday morning. However, Kurtz said, it could be “some time” for certain systems that won’t just automatically recover.

### What US airlines are saying

Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued.

### 911 and banks are also impacted

In addition to flights, the technical disaster has affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong’s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service.

In Alaska, many 911 and non-emergency call centers are not working correctly across the state, Alaska State Troopers said in a Facebook post.

Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department’s computerized 911 dispatch center. “Our 911 center remains operational. If you need to call 911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,” Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its “systems have been restored.”

In New York City, 911 services are operational, the mayor’s press secretary told CNN.

“FDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,” New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday.

In New Hampshire, some 911 services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire 911 said in a post.

CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide 911 outages.
