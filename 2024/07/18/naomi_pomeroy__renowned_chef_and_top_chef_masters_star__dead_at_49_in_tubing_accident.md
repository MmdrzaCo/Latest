Naomi Pomeroy, renowned chef and “Top Chef Masters” star, died in a tubing accident in Oregon over the weekend, local authorities said. She was 49.

Pomeroy drowned in the Willamette River in Corvallis, Oregon, on Saturday, July 13th, according to a news release posted to Facebook by the Benton County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO). “An investigation by BCSO determined three floaters on tubes and a paddle board, secured together, were caught on an exposed snag in the water. One of the floaters, Naomi, was pulled under the water and held by the paddle board leash,” the sheriff’s release stated.

The other two people were safely recovered from the water. Deputies searched the water using sonar, underwater cameras and drones, according to the statement, but authorities were at first unable to find Pomeroy’s body.

On Wednesday, the sheriff’s office released an update to announce that Pomeroy’s body had been located on the Willamette River, roughly a half-mile upstream of Hyak Park between Corvallis and Albany, Oregon. The update said that canoers on the river spotted a body and called 9-1-1, and it was later determined to be Pomeroy.

Pomeroy quickly became renowned after opening her Portland restaurant, Beast, and was recognized in 2014 as the James Beard Best Chef in the Pacific Northwest. She gained national fame appearing on Bravo’s reality competition series “Top Chef Masters.”

Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer issued a statement on the tragedy on Monday. “What a loss. Naomi was not just a fabulous chef and entrepreneur, but an amazing human being. Her impact went far beyond Portland, helping establish our leadership and reputation for food excellence. She will be greatly missed,” Blumenauer said.
