Dangerous flash flooding in Arkansas and Missouri forced evacuations and washed out at least one bridge after months of rain fell in just a few hours Wednesday morning.

A rare flash flood emergency was issued for around 5,000 people in Yellville and surrounding areas of Marion County after 6 to 11 inches of rain fell in just four to five hours, according to the National Weather Service. The area typically receives just 3.5 to 4 inches of rain in the entire month of July.

The extreme rainfall rate would be expected once in 500 years, the kind of intense rainfall becoming more common as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Only around 40 flash flood emergencies are issued on average each year, but Wednesday’s was the 48th this year. It has since expired.

At least 30 homes and a nursing facility in the county were evacuated as the dangerous floodwaters hit the area, Melissa Penn, Marion County Emergency Management Director, told CNN. Approximately 80 patients from the nursing home were transported to a temporary facility.

At least one bridge in Marion County was washed out by flooding, according to the county’s social media. Other roads were inundated, and all government offices were closed Wednesday.

People were urged by officials not to venture out onto roads that were “flooded and not safe” in Flippin, also in Marion County.

“We are experiencing some major flooding in our area. Emergency personnel are out and working diligently. Please use extreme caution if you feel the need to travel,” Flippin Police Chief John Spence wrote on social media Wednesday morning.

At least one water rescue occurred just outside of Flippin city limits, according to Penn.

Heavy rain pounded northern Arkansas and southern Missouri through much of the morning. Seven inches of rain fell in less than six hours in Branson, Missouri, where roughly 14,000 people live, a once-in-1,000 year rainfall rate. Turkey Creek at Hollister, Missouri, just south of Branson, rose 12 feet in two hours Wednesday morning.

Only light rain remained by the afternoon. Lingering showers will come to an end by the evening and the area will remain dry into at least Saturday.

CNN’s Sara Tonks, Brandon Miller and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.
