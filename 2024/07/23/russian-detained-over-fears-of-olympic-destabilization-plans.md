A Russian national has been detained and placed under preliminary investigation in Paris over fears he was preparing to disrupt the Olympic Games, the Paris prosecutor’s office told CNN Tuesday.

French authorities conducted a search of the man’s residence under an administrative order, during which they unearthed evidence he was preparing, “events likely to lead to destabilization during the Olympic Games,” the prosecutor’s office said.

He was placed under preliminary investigation and placed in detention Tuesday under suspicion of: “intelligence with a foreign power with a view to provoking hostilities in France,” the prosecutor’s office added.

If convicted, the crime carries a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment.

The prosecutor’s office released no further details as to what the man was allegedly planning.

The Olympic Games begin this week with the official opening ceremony due to be held in central Paris on Friday evening.

French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said last week that some 4,000 people had been refused permission to attend events tied to the Olympics, with authorities “paying particular attention to Russian and Belarusian citizens.”

This is a developing story and will be updated.
