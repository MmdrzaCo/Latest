Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top two Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, will soon endorse Kamala Harris in her presidential bid, according to multiple sources familiar with the decision.

Jeffries told reporters Monday that he is “looking forward” to sitting down with Harris and Schumer but stopped short of endorsing her.

“Let me say that Vice President Kamala Harris has excited the community, she’s excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she’s exciting the country, and so I’m looking forward to sit down with her in person in short order with Leader Schumer,” said Jeffries, adding, “We’ll have more to say about the path forward” after the meeting.

After Jeffries spoke to reporters, he and Schumer released a joint statement praising Harris’ work to earn the nomination so far, but stopped short of endorsing her ahead of their meeting.

“Vice President Kamala Harris is off to a great start with her promise to pursue the presidential nomination in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process set forth by the Democratic National Committee,” the two Democratic leaders said. “She is rapidly picking up support from grassroots delegates from one end of the country to the other.”

Schumer and Jeffries added, “We look forward to meeting in person with Vice President Harris shortly as we collectively work to unify the Democratic Party and the country.”

In addition to the current leaders, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of the most influential Democratic lawmakers in Washington, endorsed Harris’ campaign in a statement Monday.

“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States,” Pelosi said. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for President is official, personal and political.”

Harris’ candidacy has received a steady stream of endorsements that started Sunday afternoon after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed her. Harris has the support of more than 30 Democratic senators and more than 80 House members — a number that has been consistently increasing Monday.

She also has the support of the political arms of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Congressional Progressive Caucus.
